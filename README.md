batsignal - Simple battery monitor
==================================
batsignal is a lightweight battery daemon written in C that notifies the user
about various battery states. It is intended for minimal window managers, but
can be used in any environment that supports desktop notifications via
libnotify.

Features
--------
Customizable messages via libnotify on three configurable battery levels. A
fourth configurable battery level will execute an arbitrary system command. In
order to use as few system resources as possible, fewer battery checks are
performed while the battery is discharging and the level of charge is not near a
warning level.

By default, batsignal will attempt to detect the correct battery to monitor.

Requirements
------------
Batsignal requires the following software to build:

  * C compiler
  * libnotify
  * make
  * pkg-config

Installation
------------
Run the following command to build and install batsignal:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Usage
-----
See `man batsignal` for details.

Configuration
-------------
`batsignal` is configured using command options - see `man batsignal` for a
complete list. these options can be passed manually from the terminal, added
to the command invocation in shell profile scripts, or during window manager
initialization.

### Systemd
A systemd user service can be installed by running:

    $ make install-service

And can be enabled and started with:

    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ systemctl --user enable batsignal.service
    $ systemctl --user start batsignal.service

The service unit starts `batsignal` with default options. To customize the
options used by the service, create a drop-in file that overrides `ExecStart`.
For example:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/batsignal.service.d
    $ printf '[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=batsignal -c 10 -w 30 -f 97' > ~/.config/systemd/user/batsignal.service.d/options.conf

batsignal is written by Corey Hinshaw. It was originally forked from juiced by
Aaron Marcher.

Development Notes
-----------------

For supporting language-server freatures, the  `compile_commands.json` file is necessary (at least for the clangd-lsp).
This can be generated with [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear):

    $ bear -- make
